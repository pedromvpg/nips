Zap Tags in Notes
--------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines a set of tags to set zap parameters for note payments. These parameters allow users to add optional payment conditions and instructions for their notes such as a minimum and maximum zap amount, redirecting the zap to a different user, or specific LNURL to receive zaps for that note. This can enable supporting clients to better emulate payment behaviour in notes via zaps.

## Zaps as Public Payments

This NIP aims to create a standart that extend zaps interaction for users that want to associate predefined payment conditions to notes, such as raising funds or settling bills, while creating a public proof that the payer and payee have agreed on the transaction.

These tags will help users to request specific amounts, number of zaps and\or redirect the payment to a different public key or LNURL. 

By allowing the creator of the note to specify the payment values (instead of the payer), these tag parameters minimise the friction of having to input custom amounts and reduce the risk of input incorrect values. By providing a one-tap solution to zap a specific amount the payment is expedited. 

While Vendors, creditors, and payees may need to verify payments outside of NOSTR, third party observers can cryptographically observe that payer and payee have both agreed that payment is complete by validating the zap receipt event.

## Client Behaviour

When rendering notes, clients MAY display payment parameters by including CTAs that indicate expected Zap Tags interactions.

When rendering zaps on the notes, clients MAY display exclusively the previous zaps that follow the parameters defined in the associated Zap Tags. Alternatively, previous zaps can be displayed separatedly in Zap Tag compliant and non-compliant categories.

In case the client implemets Zap Tags, users can tap to perform a zap with the specified conditions. Alternatively, as all tags are optional, users can still use a default zapping interface when zapping an event with zap tags. 

Additional zaps are always allowed unless a specific LNURL override prevents it.

Clients MAY provide users with additional fields for creating notes with tags to determine zap behaviour. In such case, clients are responsible for appending the intended tags to the respective note before being signed by the user.

## Zap Tags

The following tags are defined as OPTIONAL.

- `zap-min`       - Minimum target amount in milisats.
- `zap-max`       - Minimum target amount in milisats.
- `zap-uses`      - Number of expected zaps with an amount equal or greater than zap-min.
- `zap-payer`     - Public key hex of expected zapper
- `zap-target`    - Total amount of sats to be raised
- `zap-split`     - List of public keys and split weight
- `zap-lnurl`     - Custom LN Adress or LNURL override (if lnurl not responsive, fallback to kind0 of author?)

TODO: DETAIL AND SPECIFY EACH TAG, DISCUSS PREVIOUS ZAP TAGS

Forward zaps should include the public key of the user that payed the zap and the user that created the forward so both users have social proof.

If user specifies a `zap-payer` along with a `zap-min` when creating a note, interface should display `zap-payer` user profile info along side or incorporated in CTA.

- `zap-note`      - Note id for zap forwarding (what happens if zap-redirect and zap-lnurl are defined? Which has priority)

## Example events and use cases

### Purchase Charge
A restaurant gives the patron the option to pay privately via a lightning invoice, or publicly via a zap. If patron agrees, the restaurant will have social proof of the patronage while the patron has social proof of the expense.

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["zap-min", "18938000"]
  ],
  "content": "Thank you for shopping at @CornerStore. Your total is 18,938.",
  ...
}
```


This note pays to nostr:npub1vp8fdcyejd4pqjyrjk9sgz68vuhq7pyvnzk8j0ehlljvwgp8n6eqsrnpsw's LN-address.\nExperimenting with zap-lnurl tag, available only on https://pubpay.me ðŸ˜‰


### Debt Collection
A user wishes to publicly announce that a specific user owes a specific amount. Debtor can be tagged on the note and zap the event for a specific amount via one single tap triggering a specific amount zap. Social proof of payment is recorded on the note.

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["zap-min", "210000000"],
    ["zap-payer", "c4633ff9e5e26f8dae0ab752f31a75d829ec9a7af9c62a3d949a08355e32a661"]
  ],
  "content": "It's been 45 days and @NostrBum still owes me 210,000.",
  ...
}
```




### Bill Split
A business wishes to breakdown a bill in multiple parts for ease of payment by a group of users. Each of the users can find the note on their feed and pay an amount split in equal parts.

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["zap-min", "45534000"],
    ["zap-uses", "5"]
  ],
  "content": "Thank you for dining at @Summer_Cafe. Your total is 45,534 of a total of 227,670 split by 5.",
  ...
}
```




### Crowd Pay
User A wishes to crowd fund a zap payment request from another note while still giving credit to the user B who actually pays. Zap is redirected to the root note carrying both `user A` and `user B`.

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["zap-min", "45534000"],
    ["zap-forward", "e6921ff965e26f81ae0abfecf31a75d829ec9a7af9c62a3d949a04e75e32ae51"]
  ],
  "content": "Just had a great dinner at @Summer_Cafe. nostr:note1feypu6wke3eys7yrvwahd6n73psjpmpsscrrau3f2s86g43f2rhspfgnz3 Who want's to pay my part? Help me out, it's only 45,534 sats.",
  ...
}
```

`User A` who requested crowed payment is credited along side `user B` who actually pays the event.
`User B` has social proof it payed for `user A`.
`User A` has social proof bill was settled.
`User C` who created the original payment request has social proof of interaction with `User A`.

```json
{
  "kind": 9734,
  "tags": [
    ["amount", "21000"],
    ["lnurl", "lnurl1dp68gurn8ghj7um5v93kketj9ehx2amn9uh8wetvdskkkmn0wahz7mrww4excup0dajx2mrv92x9xp"],
    ["p", "recipientID"],
    ["e", "root_EventID"],
    ["req-e", "requesting_EventID"],
    ["req-p", "requesting_UserA_publicKey"],

  ],
  "content": "Happy to pay for your dinner!",
  "pubkey": "userB_publicKey",
  ...
}
```




### Specified LNURL
A user wishes zaps to go to a LNURL with specific parameters that react and adjust as zaps accomulate.

```json
{
  "kind": 1,
  "tags": [
    ["zap-min", "1000000"],
    ["zap-max", "7000000"],
    ["zap-uses", "30"],
    ["zap-increments", "200000"],
    ["zap-lnurl", "lnurle6921ff965e26f81ae0abfecf31a75d829ec9a7af9c62a3d949a04e75e32ae51"]
  ],
  "content": "We have 30 tickets selling starting at 1000 sats each. First 30 zaps get the tickets. Price goes up 200 sats for every sell. Payment closes after selling out",
  ...
}
```





## Related NIPs

- `zapsplits (multiple keys)` - split zap by multiple users, clients should ignore all `zap-x` tags if `zap` tags are defined.
- `zapsplits (single key)` - effectively a single split, redirects the zap but only to `pubkey`, `lud06` or `lud16`, not notes.
- `zapgoals` - wont show up on main social feed because of special event kind.
- `zapraises` - focused on raising zaps from a pool of users, could be used in conjunction with other zap-parameters tags.
